<p>Uma <strong>hipótese estatística</strong> é uma afirmação sobre o parâmetro <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> (ou a família <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>). No caso usual, tem-se duas hipóteses: <span class="math inline">\(H_0: ~\theta\in\Theta_0~\)</span>, chamada de <strong>hipótese nula</strong>, e <span class="math inline">\(H_1: ~\theta\in\Theta_1={\Theta}_0^c~\)</span>, chamada <strong>hipótese alternativa</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Um <strong>teste de hipótese</strong> é uma regra de decisão <span class="math inline">\(\varphi: \mathfrak{X} \longrightarrow \{0,1\}\)</span>, onde <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(\boldsymbol{x})=1\)</span> significa rejeitar <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> (aceitar <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>) e <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(\boldsymbol x)=0\)</span>, não rejeitar (aceitar) <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Se rejeita-se <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> (aceita-se <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>) quando <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> é verdadeira, comete-se um <strong>erro do tipo I</strong>. Por outro lado, se não rejeita-se <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> (aceita <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) quando <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> é falso, ocorre um <strong>erro do tipo II</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>O conjunto <span class="math inline">\(\varphi^{-1}(1)=\{\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathfrak{X} :~ \varphi(\boldsymbol{x})=1\}\)</span> recebe o nome de <strong>região de rejeição</strong> (ou <strong>região crítica</strong>). A <strong>função de poder</strong> do teste <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> é
<span class="math inline">\({\pi}_\varphi(\theta)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=P\left(\varphi^{-1}(1)|\theta\right)\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(=P\big(\text{&#39;Rejeitar $H_0$&#39;} | \theta\big)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Dizemos que um teste <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> tem <strong>nível de significância</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> se <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle\sup_{\theta\in\Theta_0}\pi_\varphi(\theta)\leq \alpha\)</span>. Se <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=\displaystyle\sup_{\theta\in\Theta_0}\pi_\varphi(\theta)\)</span> dizemos que o teste é de <strong>tamanho</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Uma hipótese é dita <strong>simples</strong> se contém apenas um ponto, <span class="math inline">\(H:\theta=\theta_0\)</span>. Caso contrário é chamada de <strong>hipótese composta</strong>. No caso em que <span class="math inline">\(H:\theta\in\Theta_0\)</span> é tal que <span class="math inline">\(\dim(\Theta_0)&lt;\dim(\Theta)\)</span>, diz-se que <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> é uma <strong>hipótese precisa</strong> (“<em>sharp</em>”).</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>

<div id="revisão-abordagem-frequentista" class="section level2" number="6.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Revisão: Abordagem Frequentista</h2>
<p>Um teste de hipótese “ideal” seria aquele que as probabilidades de erros tipo I e tipo II são iguais a zero, isto é, <span class="math inline">\(\pi_\varphi(\theta)=0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\forall \theta \in \Theta_0\)</span>, e <span class="math inline">\(\pi_\varphi(\theta)=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\forall \theta \in \Theta_1\)</span>. Contudo, não é possível obter tais testes em geral.</p>
<p>A solução usual é fixar um nível de significância <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> e considerar apenas a classe de teste de nível <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, isto é, testes tais que <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle\sup_{\theta\in\Theta_0}\pi_\varphi(\theta) \leq \alpha\)</span>. Os testes ótimos sob o ponto de vista frequentista são aqueles na classe de testes de nível alpha que tenha maior função poder <span class="math inline">\({\pi}_\varphi(\theta)\)</span> para <span class="math inline">\(\theta \in \Theta_1\)</span>. Um teste que satisfaz isso é chamado de <strong>Teste Uniformemente Mais Poderoso</strong> (<strong>UMP</strong>) mas testes com essa propriedade também só podem ser obtidos em casos específicos.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Exemplo.</strong> Considere que <span class="math inline">\(\Theta=[0,1]\)</span> e deseja-se testar <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \theta \leq 0.5\)</span> contra <span class="math inline">\(H_1: \theta &gt; 0.5\)</span>. O gráfico a seguir ilustra as funções poder dos quatro testes disponíveis para esse problema. Supondo (apenas para fins didáticos) que <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.5\)</span>, temos que o teste UMP de nível <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> é o teste 2. O teste 4, apesar de ser mais poderoso, não é um teste de nível <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="InfBayes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Uma das situações onde é possível obter o teste mais poderoso é o caso que as hipóteses nula e alternativa são simples, isto é, <span class="math inline">\(H_0:\theta=\theta_0\)</span> contra <span class="math inline">\(H_1:\theta=\theta_1\)</span>. Nesses casos, pode-se considerar o <strong>Lema de Neyman-Pearson</strong>, que afirma que o <strong>teste mais poderoso</strong> é dado por</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\({\varphi}^*(\boldsymbol x)=\left\{\begin{array}{rl} 1,&amp; \dfrac{f(x|\theta_0)}{f(x|\theta_1)}\leq k\\ 0,&amp; c.c.\end{array}\right.~.\)</span></p>
<p>Além disso, o teste <span class="math inline">\({\varphi}^*\)</span> minimiza a combinação linear das probabilidades de erro <span class="math inline">\(a\alpha+b\beta\)</span> com <span class="math inline">\(k=b/a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha={\pi}_{{\varphi}^*}(\theta_0)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=P(\textrm{&#39;erro tipo I&#39;})\)</span> e <span class="math inline">\(\beta=1-{\pi}_{{\varphi}^*}(\theta_1)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=P(\textrm{&#39;erro tipo II&#39;})\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Como dito anteriorimente, usualmente é fixado um nível <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> e isso permite encontrar o valor de <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> de modo que o teste construído a partir do lema é o teste mais poderoso de nível <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. Assim,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(={\pi}_{\varphi^*}(\theta_0)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=P\left(\boldsymbol X \in {\varphi}^{-1}(\{1\})|\theta_0\right)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=P\left(\left\{\boldsymbol x: \dfrac{f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_0)}{f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_1)} \leq k\right\}\Big|\theta_0\right)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suponha que foi observado <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol X = \boldsymbol x_o\)</span>, é possível calcular o <em>nível descritivo</em> (ou <em>p-value</em>) da seguinte forma:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p(\boldsymbol x_o)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=P\left(\left\{\boldsymbol x: \dfrac{f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_0)}{f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_1)} \leq \dfrac{f(\boldsymbol x_o|\theta_0)}{f(\boldsymbol x_o|\theta_1)}\right\}\Big|\theta_0\right)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>É possível obter testes UMP em alguns casos particulares. Em especial, nos casos em que a família de distribuições para <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol X\)</span> condicional a <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> possui a propriedade de <em>razão de verossimilhanças monótona</em>, é possível construir testes UMP para hipóteses do tipo <span class="math inline">\(H_1: \theta \leq \theta_0\)</span> contra <span class="math inline">\(H_1: \theta &gt; \theta_0\)</span>. Para problemas onde as hipóteses são da forma <span class="math inline">\(H_1: \theta = \theta_0\)</span> contra <span class="math inline">\(H_1: \theta \neq \theta_0\)</span>, bastante comuns no dia a dia de um estatístico, não existe teste UMP, em geral.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Nos casos em que não existe um teste UMP, o teste mais utilizado sob a abordagem frequentista certamente é o <strong>teste da razão de verossimilhança generalizada</strong> (RVG). Primeiramente, considere a <em>razão de verossimilhanças generalizada</em>, dada por</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\lambda(\boldsymbol x)=\dfrac{\displaystyle \sup_{\theta\in\Theta_0} f(\boldsymbol x|\theta)}{\displaystyle \sup_{\theta\in\Theta} f(\boldsymbol x|\theta)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note que <span class="math inline">\(0\leq \lambda(\boldsymbol x) \leq 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\forall ~\boldsymbol x \in \mathfrak{X}\)</span> e <span class="math inline">\(\forall ~\Theta_0 \subseteq \Theta\)</span>. Um <em>teste RVG</em> é qualquer teste da forma</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\({\varphi}_{RV}(\boldsymbol x)=\left\{\begin{array}{rl} 1,&amp; \lambda(\boldsymbol x) \leq k\\ 0,&amp; c.c.\end{array}\right.~.\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Novamente, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> pode ser escolhido de modo que o teste resultante seja de nível <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, isto é, <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \sup_{\theta \in \Theta_0} P\left(\lambda(\boldsymbol x) \leq k \Big | \theta\right) \leq \alpha\)</span>. Do mesmo modo, se foi observado <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol X=\boldsymbol x_o\)</span>, um <em>p-value</em> é <span class="math inline">\(p(\boldsymbol x_o)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=\displaystyle \sup_{\theta \in \Theta_0}P\left(\left\{\boldsymbol x: \lambda(\boldsymbol x) \leq \lambda(\boldsymbol x_o)\right\}\big|\theta\right)\)</span>. Por fim, em casos onde é difícil fazer os cálculos de forma exata e o tamanho amostral <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> é razoavelmente grande, é possível usar a distribuição assintótica da RVG <span class="math inline">\(~-2\log \lambda(\boldsymbol x)\overset{\mathcal{D}}{~\longrightarrow~}\chi_d^2\)</span>, onde <span class="math inline">\(d=\dim(\Theta)-\dim(\Theta_0)\)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Abordagem Bayesiana (via Teoria da Decisão)</h2>
<p>Sob a abordagem de teoria da decisão, podemos ver um teste de hipóteses como um problema de decisão onde temos duas possíveis decisões <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}=\{d_0,d_1\}\)</span>, onde <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> é decidir por <span class="math inline">\(H_0:\theta \in \Theta_0\)</span> e <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> é decidir por <span class="math inline">\(H_1:\theta \in \Theta_1\)</span>, com <span class="math inline">\(\Theta=\Theta_0\cup\Theta_1\)</span>. Um teste de hipóteses nesse contexto é uma função de decisão <span class="math inline">\(\varphi: \mathfrak{X} \longrightarrow \{0,1\}\)</span>, de modo que quando <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(\boldsymbol x)=i\)</span>, decide-se por <span class="math inline">\(d_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i\in \{0,1\}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Primeiramente, considere o contexto apresentado no Lema de Neyman-Pearson, onde <span class="math inline">\(\Theta=\{\theta_0,\theta_1\}\)</span> e deseja-se testar <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \theta=\theta_0\)</span> contra <span class="math inline">\(H_1: \theta = \theta_1\)</span>. Considere que, a priori, <span class="math inline">\(f(\theta_0) = \pi\)</span>, a função de verossimilhança é <span class="math inline">\(f(\boldsymbol x |\theta)\)</span> e a função de perda apresentada na tabela a seguir.</p>

<p>Então, o risco de uma função de decisão <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> é</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rho(\varphi,P)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=E\left[L(\varphi(\boldsymbol X),\theta)\right]\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(= \pi~E\left[L(\varphi(\boldsymbol X),\theta)\big|\theta_0)\right] + (1-\pi)E\left[L(\varphi(\boldsymbol X),\theta)\big|\theta_1)\right]\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(= a~\pi~P\left(\varphi(\boldsymbol x)=1\big|\theta_0\right) + b~(1-\pi)~P\left(\varphi(\boldsymbol x)=0\big|\theta_1\right)\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(= a~\pi~\alpha_\varphi + b~(1-\pi)~\beta_\varphi\)</span></p>
<p>Como o risco acima é uma combinação linear das probabilidades dos erro tipo I e tipo II, podemos aplicar o Lema de Neyman-Pearson e obter a função de decisão <span class="math inline">\(\varphi^*\)</span> que minimiza o risco</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\({\varphi}^*(\boldsymbol x)=\left\{\begin{array}{rl} 1,&amp; \dfrac{f(x|\theta_0)}{f(x|\theta_1)}\leq \dfrac{b~(1-\pi)}{a~\pi}\\ 0,&amp; c.c.\end{array}\right.~.\)</span></p>
<p>Esse resultado é apresentado por DeGroot (1986) e é uma espécie de <em>Lema de Neyman-Pearson Generalizado</em>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>A solução para esse mesmo problema pode também ser obtida usando a <em>forma extensiva</em>. O risco posterior para as suas decisões é <span class="math inline">\(r_x(d_0) = b f(\theta_1|\boldsymbol x)\)</span> e <span class="math inline">\(r_x(d_1) = a f(\theta_0|\boldsymbol x)\)</span>, de modo que rejeitamos <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> (decidimos por <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> ou <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(\boldsymbol x)=1\)</span>) se</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(r_x(d_1) \leq r_x(d_0)\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(\Longleftrightarrow a f(\theta_0|\boldsymbol x) \leq b f(\theta_1|\boldsymbol x)\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(\Longleftrightarrow a f(\theta_0|\boldsymbol x) \leq b \left[1-f(\theta_0|\boldsymbol x)\right]\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(\Longleftrightarrow f(\theta_0|\boldsymbol x) \leq \dfrac{b}{a+b}\)</span></p>
<p>De modo que o teste de Bayes também pode ser apresentado como</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\({\varphi}^*(\boldsymbol x)=\left\{\begin{array}{rl} 1,&amp; f(\theta_0|\boldsymbol x) \leq \dfrac{b}{a+b} \\ 0,&amp; c.c.\end{array}\right.~.\)</span></p>
<p>A interpreção nesse caso é mais direta, a hipótese é rejeitada se sua probabilidade posterior é “pequena.” Como vimos, essas soluções são equivalentes. De fato,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(\theta_0|\boldsymbol x)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=\dfrac{f(\theta_0)f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_0)}{f(\boldsymbol x)}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=\pi~\dfrac{f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_0)}{f(\boldsymbol x)}\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(\theta_1|\boldsymbol x)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=\dfrac{f(\theta_1)f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_1)}{f(\boldsymbol x)}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=(1-\pi)~\dfrac{f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_1)}{f(\boldsymbol x)}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Assim,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(r_x(d_1) \leq r_x(d_0)\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(\Longleftrightarrow a \pi~\dfrac{f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_0)}{f(\boldsymbol x)} \leq b (1-\pi)~\dfrac{f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_1)}{f(\boldsymbol x)}\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(\Longleftrightarrow \dfrac{f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_0)}{f(\boldsymbol x|\theta_1)} \leq \dfrac{b (1-\pi)}{a \pi}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Considere agora um caso mais geral, onde <span class="math inline">\(\Theta=\Theta_0 \dot{\cup} \Theta_1\)</span> e deseja-se testar <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \theta \in \Theta_0\)</span> contra <span class="math inline">\(H_1: \theta \in \Theta_1\)</span>.

<p>Nesse exemplo, é possível ver que tanto o Fator de Bayes quanto a probabilidade posterior da hipótese nula “ordenam” o espaço amostral, representado aqui pela estatística suficiente, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span>. Deste modo, quanto menores os valores dessas estatísticas de teste, mais desfavorável é o ponto amostral para a hipótese nula. Como visto anteriormente, as regras de decisão baseadas nessas estatísticas são equivalentes e, portanto, a ordenação do espaço amostral é a mesma.</p>

<p><strong>Problema:</strong> Suponha agora que, nesse mesmo exemplo, deseja-se testar <span class="math inline">\(H_0:\theta=0\)</span> contra <span class="math inline">\(H_1: \theta\neq 0\)</span>. Como a posteriori é Normal, temos que <span class="math inline">\(P(\theta \in \Theta_0|\boldsymbol x)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=P(\theta=0|\boldsymbol x)=0\)</span> , <span class="math inline">\(\forall~ \boldsymbol x\in \mathfrak{X}~\)</span> e, desta forma, a hipótese nula <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> sempre é rejeitada.</p>
<p>De fato, para qualquer cenário em que a hipótese <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> tem medida nula a priori, <span class="math inline">\(P(\theta \in \Theta_0)=0\)</span>, tem-se que, a posteriori, <span class="math inline">\(P(\theta \in \Theta_0|\boldsymbol x)=0\)</span>. Isso ocorre frequentemente nos casos em que <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> é uma <em>hipótese precisa</em>, isto é, <span class="math inline">\(dim(\Theta_0)&lt;dim(\Theta)\)</span>.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.8</span> FBST - <em>Full Bayesian Significance Test</em></h2>
<p>Essa solução foi apresentada por Pereira e Stern em 1999. Suponha que o objetivo é testar <span class="math inline">\(H_0:\theta\in\Theta_0\)</span> contra <span class="math inline">\(H_1:\theta \in \Theta_1=\Theta_0^c\)</span>. Seja <span class="math inline">\(T_x=\left\{\theta\in\Theta ~:~f(\theta|\boldsymbol x)\geq \underset{\theta\in\Theta_0}{sup}f(\theta|\boldsymbol x)\right\}\)</span> a <em>região tangente à hipóteses <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span></em>, formada pelos pontos densidade posterior maior ou igual que qualquer ponto da hipótese nula. Se esse conjunto é “grande” (muito provável), a hipótese nula está em uma região de pouca densidade posterior e deve ser rejeitada. Assim, a <em>medida de evidência (de Pereira-Stern)</em> ou <strong><em>e-value</em></strong> é definido por <span class="math inline">\(Ev(\Theta_0,\boldsymbol x)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=1-P\left(\theta\in T_x \big|\boldsymbol x \right)\)</span>, e deve-se rejeitar <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> se o <em>e-value</em> for “pequeno.”</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Exemplo.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(X_1,...,X_n\)</span> c.i.i.d. <span class="math inline">\(N(\theta,{\sigma}_0^2)\)</span>, com <span class="math inline">\({\sigma}_0^2\)</span> conhecido. Novamente, considere <span class="math inline">\(\theta\sim N(m,v^2)\)</span>, de modo que <span class="math inline">\(\theta|\boldsymbol x \sim N\left(\dfrac{{\sigma}_0^2m+nv^2\bar{x}}{{\sigma}_0^2+nv^2},\dfrac{{\sigma}_0^2v^2}{{\sigma}_0^2+nv^2}\right)\)</span> e denote a média e a variância da posteriori por <span class="math inline">\(M_x\)</span> e <span class="math inline">\(V_x\)</span>, respectivamente. Suponha que o interesse é testar <span class="math inline">\(H_0:\theta=\theta_0\)</span> contra <span class="math inline">\(H_1:\theta\neq\theta_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Sem perda de generalidade, suponha que <span class="math inline">\(M_x \geq \theta_0\)</span>. Então, como a normal é simétrica em torno de <span class="math inline">\(M_x\)</span>, a região tangente é da forma <span class="math inline">\(T_x=[\theta_0,2M_x-\theta_0]\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="InfBayes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Note que quanto mais próximo <span class="math inline">\(M_x\)</span> está de <span class="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span>, menor a região <span class="math inline">\(T_x\)</span> e, portanto, maior o valor da evidência em favor de <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. O valor da evidência pode ser calculado por</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Ev(\Theta_0,x)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(1-P\left(\theta_0\leq \theta\leq2M-\theta_0|x\right)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(1-P\left(\dfrac{\theta_0-M}{\sqrt V}\leq Z\leq \dfrac{2M-\theta_0-M}{\sqrt V}|x\right)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(2\Phi\left(-\dfrac{|\theta_0-M|}{\sqrt V}\right)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(2\Phi\left(-\dfrac{\left|\dfrac{{\sigma}_0^2m+nv^2\bar{x}}{{\sigma}_0^2+nv^2}-\theta_0\right|}{\dfrac{{\sigma}_0 v}{\sqrt{{\sigma}_0^2+nv^2}}}\right)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(2\Phi\left(-\dfrac{\sqrt{{\sigma}_0^2+nv^2}}{{\sigma}_0 v}\dfrac{|{\sigma}_0^2(m-\theta_0)+nv^2(\bar x-\theta_0)|}{\sqrt{{\sigma}_0^2+nv^2}}\right)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(2\Phi\left(-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{{\sigma}_0^2+nv^2}}\left|\dfrac{{\sigma}_0}{v}(m-\theta_0)+\dfrac{\sqrt n v}{{\sigma}_0}(\bar x-\theta_0)\right|\right)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(2\Phi\left(-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{{\sigma}_0^2+nv^2}}\left|\dfrac{(m-\theta_0)}{v/{\sigma}_0}+\sqrt nv\dfrac{(\bar x-\theta_0)}{{\sigma}_0/\sqrt n}\right|\right)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Sob a abordagem frequentista, temos que o <em>p-value</em> é</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p(\boldsymbol x)\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(= 1-P\left(-\dfrac{|\bar X-\theta_0|}{{\sigma}_0/\sqrt n}\leq Z \leq \dfrac{|\bar X-\theta_0|}{{\sigma}_0/\sqrt n}\right)\)</span>

<span class="math inline">\(\Longleftrightarrow -\dfrac{|\bar X-\theta_0|}{{\sigma}_0/\sqrt n}=\Phi^{-1}\left(\dfrac{p-valor}{2}\right)\)</span>,</p>
<p>de modo que, nesse exemplo, podemos escrever</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Ev(\Theta_0,x)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(2\Phi\left(-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{{\sigma}_0^2+nv^2}}~\left|\dfrac{(m-\theta_0)}{v/{\sigma}_0}+\sqrt nv~\Phi\left(\dfrac{p(\boldsymbol x)}{2}\right)\right|\right)\)</span>.</p>

<p>Suponha que um estatístico frequentista decida rejeitar <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> se o <em>p-value</em> for menor que <em>0.05</em>. Para que a decisão baseada no <em>e-value</em> concorde com o resultado frequentista (para esse particular exemplo), deve-se rejeitar a hipótese se o <em>e-value</em> for menor que <em>0.2</em>, aproximadamente.

<span class="math inline">\(~\Longrightarrow~ p(\boldsymbol X)= 2\Phi\left(-\dfrac{\sqrt{n}|\bar{X}-\theta_0|}{{\sigma}_0}\right) ~{\longrightarrow}~ 0\)</span>,</p>
<p>com probabilidade 1. Por outro lado, sob <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \theta=\theta_0\)</span>, pelo Teorema Central do Limite,</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>Esses resultados para o <em>p-value</em> são bastante conhecidos. No contexto desse exemplo, é possível obter resultados similares para o <em>e-value</em>. Novamente, considere que <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> é falso e, sem perda de generalidade, <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\theta^*&gt;\theta_0\)</span>. Note que</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{{\sigma}_0(m-\theta_0)}{v\sqrt{{\sigma}_0^2+nv^2}} ~\longrightarrow~ 0\)</span></p>

<p>Além disso, <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{v\sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{{\sigma}_0^2+nv^2}} ~\longrightarrow~ 1\)</span> e, sob <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \theta = \theta_0\)</span>,</p>

<p>de modo que</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.9</span> P-value - Nivel de Significância Adaptativo</h2>
<p>Recentemente, o <em>p-value</em> e a utilização do famoso nível <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> têm sido muito questionados, não apenas na área de testes de hipóteses mas na ciência como um todo. A ideia de fixar um nível de significância é que a probabilidade de <em>erro tipo I</em> fica “controlada” e a probabilidade do <em>erro tipo II</em> diminui quanto maior o tamanho amostral. Por essa razão, é comum nas áreas de planejamento de experimentos e amostragem, o cálculo do tamanho amostral para um determinado estudo. Infelizmente, na maior parte dos problemas do dia a dia de um estatístico, não há um planejamento cuidadoso ou as amostras disponíveis são “amostras de conveniência.” Simultaneamente, com a “revolução da informação,” a quantidade de dados disponível é cada vez maior. A consequência disso no cenário de testes de hipóteses é que os testes ficam muito poderosos e há uma tendência maior de rejeitar a hipótese nula.</p>

<p>Note que todas as medidas de suporte da hipótese tendem a zero conforme aumenta o tamanho amostral. Isso indica que se <span class="math inline">\(|\bar{x}_n-\theta_0|=\varepsilon\)</span> e for fixado um valor de corte para essas medidas que não dependa do tamanho amostral (por exemplo, o <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> para o <em>p-value</em>), existe um <span class="math inline">\(n^*\)</span> tal que <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> será rejeitado para todo <span class="math inline">\(n\geq n^*\)</span>. No gráfico, a linha vertical tracejada indica o valor <span class="math inline">\(n^*\)</span> para o <em>p-value</em> considerando o corte <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span>.</p>

<p>Como visto anteriormente, o Lema de Neyman-Pearson Generalizado (DeGroot, 1986) garante que os testes Bayesianos (baseados na probabilidade posterior ou no BF) minimizam <span class="math inline">\(a\alpha + b\beta\)</span>. Baseado nesse resultado, O professor Carlos A. B. Pereira recentemente propôs um novo procedimento de teste para evitar o problema descrito anteriormente.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Seja <span class="math inline">\(BF(\boldsymbol x) = \dfrac{f_0(\boldsymbol x)}{f_1(\boldsymbol x)}\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(=\dfrac{\displaystyle\int_{\Theta_0} f(\boldsymbol x|\theta) dP_0(\theta)}{\displaystyle \int_{\Theta_1} f(\boldsymbol x|\theta) dP_1(\theta)}\)</span>, onde <span class="math inline">\(P_i\)</span> é a medida de probabilidade a priori para <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> restrito à hipótese <span class="math inline">\(H_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i=0,1\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>Defina
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_n = P\left(\left\{\boldsymbol x : BF(\boldsymbol x)\leq\dfrac{b}{a}\right\} ~\Big|~ \Theta_0\right)\)</span> e
<span class="math inline">\(\beta_n = P\left(\left\{\boldsymbol x : BF(\boldsymbol x)&gt;\dfrac{b}{a}\right\} ~\Big|~ \Theta_1\right)\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>Suponha que foi observado <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol X=\boldsymbol x_o\)</span>. O <strong>P-value</strong> é dado por
<span class="math inline">\(\text{P-value}(\boldsymbol x_o) = P\left(\left\{\boldsymbol x : BF(\boldsymbol x)\leq BF(\boldsymbol x_o)\right\} ~\Big|~ \Theta_0\right)\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>O procedimento de teste consiste em rejeitar <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> se <span class="math inline">\(\text{P-value}(\boldsymbol x) &lt; \alpha_n\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Voltando ao Exemplo.</strong> As distribuções preditivas sob <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \theta=\theta_0=1/2\)</span> e <span class="math inline">\(H_1:\theta \neq 1/2\)</span> são</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_0(\boldsymbol x)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(= f(\boldsymbol x | \theta_0)\)</span>

<p><span class="math inline">\(f_1(\boldsymbol x)\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(=\displaystyle \int_{\Theta\setminus\theta_0} f(\boldsymbol x|\theta) f(\theta) d\theta\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(=\displaystyle \int_0^1 \binom{n}{x} \dfrac{{\theta}_0^{a+x-1} (1-{\theta}_0)^{b+n-x-1}}{\beta(a,b)}~d\theta\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(=\displaystyle \binom{n}{x}\dfrac{\beta(a+x,b+n-x)}{\beta(a,b)}\)</span> .</p>
<p>Deste modo,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(BF(\boldsymbol x)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(=\dfrac{f_0(\boldsymbol x)}{f_1(\boldsymbol x)}\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(=\dfrac{\beta(a,b)~{\theta}_0^x (1-{\theta}_0)^{n-x}}{\beta(a+x,b+n-x)}\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(=\dfrac{\beta(a,b)~(1/2)^{n}}{\beta(a+x,b+n-x)}\)</span>,</p>
<p>e, assim,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha_n = \displaystyle {(1/2)^{n}} \sum_{\left\{\boldsymbol x: BF(\boldsymbol x)\leq\frac{b}{a}\right\}}\binom{n}{x}\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_n = \displaystyle \dfrac{1}{{\beta(a,b)}} \sum_{\left\{\boldsymbol x: BF(\boldsymbol x)&gt;\frac{b}{a}\right\}}\binom{n}{x}\beta(a+x,b+n-x)\)</span>,</p>
